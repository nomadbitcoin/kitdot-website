# kitdot: TypeScript Development Toolkit for Polkadot Cloud

## Overview

kitdot is a TypeScript CLI toolkit for building fully decentralized applications on Polkadot Cloud infrastructure. It provides standardized project templates and scaffolding for developers working with smart contracts, frontends, and decentralized cloud services. Currently in development as a project initialization tool with upcoming features for complete dApp development workflow.

## Problem Statement

**Awareness**: Developers working with Polkadot Cloud face fragmented tooling
**Acquisition**: Setting up new projects requires manual configuration of multiple tools
**Activation**: First API calls and contract deployments involve complex setup
**Retention**: Inconsistent patterns make long-term development difficult
**Product**: Missing standardized workflows for Polkadot Cloud development

## Solution Architecture

kitdot addresses these issues through:

## Current Features

### Project Initialization

```bash
kitdot init my-project
```

- Generates standardized project structure for Polkadot Cloud
- Includes frontend, contracts, and cloud-functions templates
- TypeScript configuration for all components
- Basic project scaffolding and dependencies setup

## Coming Soon Features

### MCP Server Integration

- Model Context Protocol server for AI development assistance
- Automated code generation and smart contract interaction
- Intelligent project analysis and recommendations

### Enhanced Templates

- Templates with seamless wallet generation and onboarding
- Pre-configured authentication flows
- Ready-to-use wallet integration patterns

### 130 Pre-built Smart Contracts

- Audited contract library from thirdweb integration
- NFT, token, marketplace, and governance contracts
- One-command deployment of battle-tested contracts
- Upgradeable proxy patterns included

### Fully Decentralized Cloud Services

- **Acurast Parachain**: Decentralized cloud functions execution
- **Crust Network**: IPFS hosting and storage via Apillon SDK
- **Polkadot Cloud Native**: No AWS or traditional web2 dependencies
- Complete decentralized application stack
